### Carnation Leaf Agar (CLA)

Notes for _Fusarium_: Used for getting good macroconidia formation for identification.

| Ingredient | Amount |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Carnation Leaves | |
| Agar | 20 grams |

1.  Collect carnation leaves and cut into 3-5 mm2 pieces.
2.  Microwave ~30 seconds to sterilize and dry.
3.  Make 2% water agar:
a.  Add 20 g agar (Fisher # BP1423-500) to 1 L of H2O.
b.  Autoclave for 20 minutes on the fluid setting.
c.  Cool in a water bath to ~50°C.
4.  Add 10-15 pieces of carnation to each plate.
5.  Pour ~30 mL water agar into each plate.

### Lactic acid PDA (APDA)

Good for _Fusarium graminearum_ and allies. Used for isolation and for inoculating corn and MB broth.  Lactic acid inhibits bacterial growth.

| Ingredient | Amount |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Potato Dextrose Agar | 39 grams |
| 85% Lactic Acid | 1 mL |
| Distilled H20 | |

1.  Add 39 g PDA to 1 L distilled H2O.
2.  Autoclave for 20 minutes on the fluid setting.
3.  Cool in a water bath to approximately 50°C.
4.  Add 1 mL 85% Lactic acid and swirl to mix.
5.  Pour approximately 30 mL per plate.

PDA odered before was Fisher #DF0013176

### Mung Bean Agar (MBA)

Used for _Fusarium_ spore production on culture plates.  Protocol developed by the lab of Dr. Ruth Dill-Macky.

| Ingredient | Amount |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| | |

1.  Boil water in 2 L beaker.
2.  Place beans in water and boil for 25 min.
NOTE:  Time from when the water has returned to the boil.  The beans will have started to crack open by 25 min (this may happen as early as 15 min).  Good spore production is dependent on a cooking time of 25 minutes.
3.  Remove bean broth from heat.
4.  Mark 1 liter volume on the side of a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask.
5.  Place a large Buchner funnel on the flask.
6.  Line the funnel using two gauze pads (4-6 layers of cheesecloth may be substituted). Ensure that the gauze/cheesecloth covers the funnel holes.
7.  Pour the bean broth slowly into the flask through the funnel
8.  Discard the beans (and gauze) from the funnel
9.  Soak the funnel and beaker in water
NOTE:  The residue is difficult to remove once dried onto surfaces!
10. Adjust the total volume of broth up to 1 liter by adding distilled water to the mark on the flask
11. Add 15 grams of agar (Fisher # BP1423-500) and mix.
12. Autoclave at 115 oC for 20 minutes, fluid setting
13. Cool in a water bath to ~50°C.
14. Pour ~30 mL per plate.

### Mung Bean Broth (MBB)

Good for _Fusarium_ spore production in liquid culture.

| Ingredient | Amount |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| | |

1.  Bring 1 L distilled H2O to a boil.
2.  Remove from heat and allow to sit 30 seconds.
3.  Add 40 g of mung beans and allow to steep 10 minutes.
4.  Fix a Buchner funnel to a 2 L flask and cover the holes with cheesecloth.  Filter the beans from the broth.
5.  Divide the broth as needed into flasks and put a sponge cork in the top.
6.  Autoclave 20 minutes on the fluid setting.
7.  Allow broth to cool overnight before inoculating.
