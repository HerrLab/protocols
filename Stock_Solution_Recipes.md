# Herr Lab - Recipes for Stock Solutions

## TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA) (10X)

108 gm Tris Base (Trizma)
55 g boric acid
40 ml 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)

Add the above to 800 mL dH2O. Stir until dissolved. Adjust to 1 L with additional dH2O.

Store at room temperature.

## 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)

Add:
186.1 g of disodium EDTA (Na2EDTA)
800 mL of dH2O

Adjust the pH to 8.0 with NaOH (approximately 50 ml of NaOH)

Bring volume to 1 L with dH2O

Stir vigorously on a magnetic stirrer*

Sterilize by autoclaving

Store at room temperature

*The disodium salt of EDTA will not dissolve until the pH of the solution is adjusted to
8.0 by the addition of NaOH.*

## 1 M Tris-HCl

Dissolve:
121. g Tris Base (TRIZMA)
700 ml dH2O

Add concentrated HCl to desired pH:
pH 7.4 : approximately 70 mL
pH 8.0 : approximately 42 mL
pH 9.0 : approximately 8 mL

Fill up to volume 1 L with dH2O. Sterilize by autoclaving for 20 minutes on liquid
setting. Store at room temperature.

## Tris-EDTA 100X

(1.0M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M EDTA, pH 8.0)
157.6 g Tris-HCL
37.22 g EDTA

Bring the solution up to 1 Lt with H2O (before you must adjust the pH to 8 using NaOH)

If preparing only 250 ml:
39.4 g Tris-HCL
9.03 g EDTA
Bring the solution up to 250 ml with H2O (before you must adjust the pH to 8 using
NaOH)

## EDTA 0.5 M

186.1 g EDTA
Bring the solution up to 1 Lt with H2O (adjust pH to 8 with NaOH)

If preparing only 250 ml:
46.53 g EDTA
Bring the solution up to 250 ml with H2O (adjust pH to 8 with appoximately 5g NaOH)

## DTT (Dithiothreitol) 400mg/ml

0.4 g in 1 ml H2O
If you will prepare the entire bottle of DTT (1 g) then you just add 2.5 ml of H2O

## NaCl 5 M

292.2 g in 1 LT H2O

If preparing only 100 ml:
29.2 g in 100 ml H2O

## 5X Extraction Buffer – 40 ml Stock

2 ml Tris + EDTA (100X)
7.6 ml EDTA (0.5 M)
0.4 ml NaCl (5 M)
30 ml ddH2O

## SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulfate) 10%

Dissolve:
10 g of SDS in 80 mL of H2O, and then add H20 to 100 mL

## Extraction Solution Recipe (1 RXN)

Water 520 ul
5X Extraction Buffer 160 ul
SDS 10% 80 ul
Proteinase K 10 mg/mL 20 ul
DTT 400 mg/mL 20 ul
Total volume 800 ul

## Bromophenol Blue Loading Dye (6X)

*Note: dark blue runs faster on the gel*

*Recipe 1:*
For 100 mL:
60 g glycerol into a 100-mL graduated cylinder
12 mL 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8
Add 10 mg bromophenol blue

Bring up the volume to 100 mL with ddH2O

*Recipe 2:*
100 mg Bromophenol Blue
6 g of Ficoll (Type 400)
Fill up to 40 ml with dH2O

Dissolve well. It takes a while. An option is to shake at 37 degrees overnight. Store at
room temperature.

## GelRed Gel: Use dark 1.5 ml tubes. Store stock solution at dark place and room temperature.
